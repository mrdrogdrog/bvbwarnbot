# BVB-Warning-Bot

This is a telegram and matrix bot that announces upcoming games of the local
soccer team [Borussia Dortmund](https://bvb.de).

## Why?

I'm not a big fan of soccer and even less of the fans that are filling public transport and the main station.
So this bot will help me to avoid public transport on these days.

## Origins

This is not the first bvbwarnbot. The original bot ran on Twitter and has been maintained by [Anathem](https://toot.kif.rocks/@anathem).
After Elon fucked everything, anathem has moved it over to [Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@bvbwarnbot).

## Is it running somewhere?

Yes. I run one instance for these channels:
- Telegram: https://t.me/dortmund_oepnv_warnungen
- Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/#dortmund_oepnv:atteroth.de
